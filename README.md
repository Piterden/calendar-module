  Calendar layout for PyroCMS 3 CP Table Builder, v0.0.1                                                                    

```
> Before there was time, man invented the Calendar. The idea was to preemptively manage time before it engulfs your life. The ability to make future plans, set events, reminders and take timely actions. A chance to fight back!. All of that, now made possible by the :calendar: Calendar Module.

![Calendar](https://github.com/websemantics/calendar-module/raw/master/docs/calendar.gif "Calendar")

## Getting Started

This module demonstrates a Calendar view for the [TableBuilder](http://pyrocms.com/documentation/streams-platform/v1.1#ui/tables). It is work in progress so expect things to change radically.

To install,

1- Clone this repo inside your project at, `addons/default/websemantics/calendar-module`,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/websemantics/calendar-module
```

2- Install the module

```bash
php artisan module:install websemantics.module.calendar
```

## Events Stream

The Events stream and its [entity classes](https://github.com/websemantics/builder-extension#stream-entities) were auto-generated by the [Builder](https://github.com/websemantics/builder-extension) extension.

The stream fields and migration files were created using the following artisan command,

```bash
php make:stream 'events:tc(title),title,start:t(anomaly.field_type.datetime),end:t(anomaly.field_type.datetime)' websemantics.module.todo
```

Check out the enhanced `make:stream` command [here](https://github.com/websemantics/builder-extension#make-stream).
